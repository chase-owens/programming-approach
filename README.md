This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Next is a [React.js](https://reactjs.org) framework that comes with support for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), a stongly-typed JS language. React is a JavaScript library for UIs. React permits re-use of code through Components that can maintain internal state independent of co-ordinate components and also access data from super-ordinate components and global stores. TypeScript is a JavaScript with syntax for types. By being a strongly-typed langugage, TypeScript improves code safety and improves the developer experience(DX) via improved editor support(intellisence when accessing object properties and error messages when access unavaialble properties).
